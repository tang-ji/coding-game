    "### The Goal\n",
    "Capture more ghosts than the rival team.\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is played on a map **16001** units wide and **9001** units high. The coordinate **X=0, Y=0** is the top left pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player controls a team of three **busters** – a **Hunter**, **Catcher**, and **Support**. The teams start out at opposite corners of the map, near their base. Ghosts are scattered across the map, and need to be trapped and brought back to a player's base to earn points. Each ghost inside the base or currently trapped by the Catcher is worth a point for the owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The map works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are always 2 teams in play.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At the start of the game, each player is given a team id. This indicates on which corner their base is positioned. The top left corner (**X=0, Y=0**) is for team **0**. The bottom right corner (**X=16000, Y=9000**) is for team **1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fog makes it impossible to know the positions of ghosts and rival busters unless they are within **2200** units from one of your own busters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each buster has a unique id. Each ghost has a unique id. Ghosts and busters with the same id are not correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Busters work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each buster has a different role and can perform different actions :\n",
    "\n",
    " - The Hunter:\n",
    " \n",
    "   He can **BUST** ghosts. He has a red outline in the viewer.\n",
    "   \n",
    " - The Catcher:\n",
    " \n",
    "   He can **TRAP** and **RELEASE** ghosts. He has a green outline in the viewer.\n",
    "   \n",
    " - The Support:\n",
    " \n",
    "   He can **STUN** other busters and use a **RADAR**. He has a blue outline in the viewer.\n",
    "   \n",
    " - In addition all busters can MOVE.\n",
    " \n",
    "**MOVE** followed by map coordinates will make the buster advance **800** units towards that point. The position will be rounded to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BUST** followed by a ghost's id will cause the Hunter to target that ghost with his proton stream, causing the ghost to lose **1** stamina point. He may do this if he is within a range of **1760** units around the target ghost but not closer than **900** units\n",
    "\n",
    "**TRAP** followed by a ghost's id will cause the Catcher to try to suck that ghost into his ghost trap. If the ghost has **0** stamina points, and if the Catcher is within a range of **1760** units around the ghost but not closer than **900** units the action will suceed. Trapped ghosts are no longer visible on the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Catcher may carry no more than **1** ghost at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RELEASE** will cause the Catcher to drop the ghost he is carrying back onto the map. If this is done within **1600** units of a corner of the map on which a base is positioned, the ghost is removed from play and secures a point for the base's owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STUN** followed by a buster's id will make the Support shoot a bolt of lightning that will stun the target buster. A stunned buster cannot do anything for **10** turns. The stun ability must recharge for **20** turns before it can be used again. Being stunned will cause a Catcher to release any ghost he may be carrying.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Support may only stun opponents within a **1760** unit radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RADAR** will cause the Support to gain extended vision through the fog and will make it possible to see all entities within **4400** units around him for the next turn. Your Support can use this ability once per game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Busters will perform their actions simultaneously but any effect the actions have, including movement, are applied at the end of the turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ghosts work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ghosts remain stationary under two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    " - They are occupying their starting position and the nearest buster is more than 2200 units away.\n",
    "\n",
    " - They are being busted.\n",
    " \n",
    "- If a buster is closer than **2200** from a ghost, and this ghost is not being busted, the ghost will move away from the mean position of the near busters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If they aren't at their starting position, the ghosts will try to return directly to it. If this makes the ghost go closer than **2200** units to a buster, it will begin to flee again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The speed of the ghosts is **400** units.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A ghost being carried by a Catcher will escape if he attempts to trap a different ghost.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ghost stamina does not regenerate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game ends once all ghosts have been captured or after the time limit of **250** turns."
